					<h2 class="blog-post-title">Artist I Respect</h2>
					<p class="blog-post-meta"> </p>
					<p> I love Music and there are alot of artist who I respect in the game music is place of creation and its also 
                        a way to showcase who we are we all hear things diffrently say things diffrently think diffrently 
                        and even just the creation of the music is beautiful I have 10 artist list 
                        crazy how most them were taken from us or don't even do music its sad when they say the
                        music industry is cut throat they mean it I mean it can cost sanity or even a talented persons life. </p>

                        that are diffrent from anyone elses and create passive streams of income in black families generational 
                        wealth is never taught depending the family and i want create generational wealth and 
                        there is nothing that can stop me from doing that i've been around the block a few times this world is full opions 
                        and if you pay attention the judgement is from someone with a poor soul in order to aqquire wealth or 
                        be rich as some would say make sure soul is rich first health is wealth mental and physical.</p>
